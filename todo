create performance variable based on yardage
-> will use format for this but create new variable based on format

cleaning:
- look at variables for extreme values and missing
- prepared data by using dsd and missover
- loaded in data
- found 33 teams rather than 32, inspected data
- missing values and nlevels
- need to figure out how to supress warnings for '-' as missing values
- check for duplicates
- merge on teams?
- merge on names, only include where they are equal (use scan to do names)
- lng cannot be greater than 100
- pct cannot be gretaer than 100
- fmbl cannot be greater than fmb
- receptions cannot be greater than tgt

formats:
- case in arrests data
- date in arrests
- reformat weeks from 101-117 to 1-17

todo:
- look at frequency of arrests by teams/city or position
- most frequent crime categories
- group by team then category/case
